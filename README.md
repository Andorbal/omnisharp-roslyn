Omnisharp based on roslyn workspaces

This currently requires dnx version - 1.0.0-beta4 (see https://github.com/aspnet/Home).. and because the omnisharp server uses kestrel, you'll also need to make sure that you have libuv installed.

If you are using mono, you'll need a minimum of verson 4.0.1

Run the server with ```./scripts/Omnisharp -s /path/to/project -p portnumber```
